\chapter{PRAEFATIO}

Hello! I made this book for myself, but I hope it can be of use to others.

This book was made in imitation of the wonderful {\it Lingua Latina per se
Illustrata} series: it includes both marginal notes in Latin and pictures in
order to minimize the need to consult a dictionary, and to keep you thinking in
Latin as you read.

The main text is the Book of Exodus as pulled from www.latinlibrary.com,
run through the Macronizer (http://alatius.com/macronizer/), and proof\-read
by me.  This text is supplemented by the {\it Quaestiones in Exodum} by
Saint Augustine, which is considerably more complex Latin than Exodus. In
these sections, Augustine raises questions about the text and attempts to  
resolve them. 

Don't be deterred if Augustine stumps you!
Just move on to the next chapter of Exodus and come back later.  

Please let me know if you've found this book useful or encounter any
issues:
