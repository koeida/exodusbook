\chapter{PRAEFATIO}

This book is intended for use after finishing the wonderful {\it Lingua Latina:
Familia Romana}.  The goal is to provide a marginal note or 
picture for every word that isn't in {\it FR}. Even if a word is glossed in 
one chapter, it will be glossed again at least once in each subsequent chapter
it is found in.  The back of the book also contains a lexicon including every marginal note. 

Exodus (and the Vulgate as a whole) has the advantage of being
relatively simple Latin, and the broad outline of
the story is familiar to many, but it's still got a number of delightful
oddities unknown to most (e.g, the inn scene in Cap. IV).

The main text is the Book of Exodus as pulled from www.\\latinlibrary.com,
run through the Macronizer (http://\\alatius.com/macronizer/), and proof\-read
by me.  

This book is currently under construction (I'll publish a hard copy upon completion),
so please let me know if you've found it useful or if encounter any issues.  I especially would appreciate feedback on
any marginal notes you find unhelpful or in need of correction:
