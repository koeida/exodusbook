Words I use everywhere that I have to figure something out for:
    * sacrificium
    * dude you use sacer/ra/rum everywhere and you don't define it

write initial chapter going over: 
    * hard-to-gloss words and quod/quia/quoniam clauses
    * in monumentum?
    * in fīliīs Isrāēl?
    * in Dominum Deum
    * common proper nouns that are irregular or indeclinable (Moyses, Israel, etc) -- maybe a bit about how a lot of these place names are indeclinable
    * herba

missing defs (grep for these throughout book):
    * removere secando partem pēnis membri siti inter crura pueri vel viri
    * assumet cap 12 et alia
    * circumcidere, circumcisio, cap 4
    * ehhh sānctus
    * ehh venerābilis: maybe dignum colī?
    * ehh benedicere
    
misc:
    * Base the header spacing on the Fabellae book you just got
    * uh, page numbers
    * Add a little summary at the end of cap 5 (I chopped out boring verses)
    * check for 'j's!
    * cūnctaque aegyptus cap 12 -- wtf? Maybe it's appositive.
    * Make sure whwat you wrote about the tablets is correct. I think it's in two places.
    * Verify that earlier art is from public domain sources
    * Get new chapter art for the repetetive ones (or non-pd ones)
    * every time theres a fermentō def there needs to be a fermentum def
    * when you do a formatting check try and pull up marginal notes that bleed into the bottom margin

images:
the chapter 6 image doesn't seem to have anything to do with the text.
the chapter 6 art kinda sucks
The chapter 5 paleam colligentes image probably is copyrighted
Chap 5 lateres needs an image
Chap 8 sciniphēs image shouldn't be the same as a fly. It needs to be smaller, at least.

golden haggadah:
http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_27210_f001r
f.10v: burning bush, talking with israelites! w/snake

lol celebrare def cap 12
not certain about festivitas cap 12

proper names -- make sure the macrons are actually correct

difficult-to-define words that I want to be able to use liberally.
Maybe make a chapter where they are defined and mark them throughout the text.

cap16 verse 32: wtf does retro mean here????

need an image for cap 18: maybe the james tissot painting of jethro and moses?

during the read-through you need to look for words that are obviously not in llpsi
like, why didn't sapphīrinī get caught by your software?

note for: reversi sunt tam Aarōn (finis 31)

caps after colons
