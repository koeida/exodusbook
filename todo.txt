Words I use everywhere that I have to figure something out for:
    * sacrificium
    * dude you use sacer/ra/rum everywhere and you don't define it
    * you use pertinens/etc everywhere and it's not in llpsi

readthrough checks:
    readthrough for proper names that maybe we can gloss

write initial chapter going over: 
    * hard-to-gloss words and quod/quia/quoniam clauses
    * in monumentum?
    * in fīliīs Isrāēl?
    * common proper nouns that are irregular or indeclinable (Moyses, Israel, etc) -- maybe a bit about how a lot of these place names are indeclinable
    * herba

missing defs (grep for these throughout book):
    * occursum, cap 4 (twice)
    * circumcidere, circumcisio, cap 4
    * Aegyptiacas cap 7, also needs to have the Ae glyph in it. I think it's more like "in the egyptian language"
    * vice cap 7
    * lectulum cap 8
    * strātum cap 8
    * huiuscemodi cap 8
    * animantia cap 9
    * fundāta cap 9
    * laesa cap 9

misc:
    * Add a little summary at the end of cap 5 (I chopped out boring verses)
    * check all the foris, and if they're adverbs, they should be forīs
    * check all the hics and hīcs and make sure they're correct
    * likewise qua and quā

images:
the chapter 6 image doesn't seem to have anything to do with the text.
the chapter 6 art kinda sucks
The chapter 5 paleam colligentes image probably is copyrighted
Chap 5 lateres needs an image
Chap 8 sciniphēs image shouldn't be the same as a fly. It needs to be smaller, at least.

golden haggadah:
http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_27210_f001r
f.10v: burning bush, talking with israelites! w/snake

lol celebrare def cap 12
not certain about festivitas cap 12

proper names -- make sure the macrons are actually correct

difficult-to-define words that I want to be able to use liberally.
Maybe make a chapter where they are defined and mark them throughout the text.

cap16 verse 32: wtf does retro mean here????

need an image for cap 18: maybe the james tissot painting of jethro and moses?

during the read-through you need to look for words that are obviously not in llpsi
like, why didn't sapphīrinī get caught by your software?

Macron Checks:
CAP 1 CHECKED
CAP 2 CHECKED
CAP 3 CHECKED
CAP 4 CHECKED
CAP 5 CHECKED
CAP 6 ??????
CAP 7 CHECKED
CAP 8 CHECKED
CAP 9 CHECKED

cultus needs a def, it's used a lot, even in other definitions

note for: reversi sunt tam Aarōn (finis 31)

caps after colons

there should be page numbers and chapter numbers at top
