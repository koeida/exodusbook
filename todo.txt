Words I use everywhere that I have to figure something out for:
    * sacrificium
    * dude you use sacer/ra/rum everywhere and you don't define it
    * you use pertinens/etc everywhere and it's not in llpsi

readthrough checks:
    readthrough for proper names that maybe we can gloss

write initial chapter going over: 
    * hard-to-gloss words and quod/quia/quoniam clauses
    * in monumentum?
    * in fīliīs Isrāēl?
    * in Dominum Deum
    * common proper nouns that are irregular or indeclinable (Moyses, Israel, etc) -- maybe a bit about how a lot of these place names are indeclinable
    * herba

missing defs (grep for these throughout book):
    * occursum, cap 4 (twice)
    * circumcidere, circumcisio, cap 4
    * Aegyptiacas cap 7, also needs to have the Ae glyph in it. I think it's more like "in the egyptian language"
    * vice cap 7
    * lectulum cap 8
    * strātum cap 8
    * huiuscemodi cap 8
    * animantia cap 9
    * fundāta cap 9
    * laesa cap 9
    * scandalum doesn't seem correct in cap 10
    * quinam cap 10
    * verses 10-11 cap 10 could use a note
    * ūrentem cap 10
    * virēns cap 10
    * hāc vice cap 10
    * absque cap 12
    * religiō cap 12
    * "congregata sunt abyssi" -- wtf? abyssus is feminine...but --- cap 15
    * tentāre def cap 16 is not that great.
    * invicem cap 16
    * occursum cap 18
    * partītō cap 18
    * "pacifica vestra" cap 20 is gonna need more explanation, cap 32 as well
    * fōrmāvit cap 32
    * indūcerēs cap 32
    * quīverō cap 32
    * pronus final
    * inībō  final
misc:
    * Base the header spacing on the Fabellae book you just got
    * Add a little summary at the end of cap 5 (I chopped out boring verses)
    * check all the foris, and if they're adverbs, they should be forīs
    * check all the hics and hīcs and make sure they're correct
    * likewise qua and quā
    * check all the words around diē -- the vulgate seems to consistently make it feminine, which trips up the macronizer
    * check for 'j's!
    * cūnctaque aegyptus cap 12 -- wtf? Maybe it's appositive.
    * watch out for omnīs instead of omnis
    * watch out for venit instead of vēnit
    * Make sure whwat you wrote about the tablets is correct. I think it's in two places.
    * Verify that earlier art is from public domain sources
    * Get new chapter art for the repetetive ones (or non-pd ones)
    * make sure all the Deus are capitalized

images:
the chapter 6 image doesn't seem to have anything to do with the text.
the chapter 6 art kinda sucks
The chapter 5 paleam colligentes image probably is copyrighted
Chap 5 lateres needs an image
Chap 8 sciniphēs image shouldn't be the same as a fly. It needs to be smaller, at least.

golden haggadah:
http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_27210_f001r
f.10v: burning bush, talking with israelites! w/snake

lol celebrare def cap 12
not certain about festivitas cap 12

proper names -- make sure the macrons are actually correct

difficult-to-define words that I want to be able to use liberally.
Maybe make a chapter where they are defined and mark them throughout the text.

cap16 verse 32: wtf does retro mean here????

need an image for cap 18: maybe the james tissot painting of jethro and moses?

during the read-through you need to look for words that are obviously not in llpsi
like, why didn't sapphīrinī get caught by your software?
