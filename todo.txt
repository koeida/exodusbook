Words I use everywhere that I have to figure something out for:
    * sacrificium
    * dude you use sacer/ra/rum everywhere and you don't define it

write initial chapter going over: 
    * hard-to-gloss words and quod/quia/quoniam clauses
    * in monumentum?
    * in fīliīs Isrāēl?
    * in Dominum Deum
    * common proper nouns that are irregular or indeclinable (Moyses, Israel, etc) -- maybe a bit about how a lot of these place names are indeclinable
    * herba
    
misc:
    * Base the header spacing on the Fabellae book you just got
    * uh, page numbers
    * Add a little summary at the end of cap 5 (I chopped out boring verses) (or just put a note in the introduction)
    * check for 'j's!
    * Make sure whwat you wrote about the tablets is correct. I think it's in two places.
    * every time theres a fermentō def there needs to be a fermentum def
    * when you do a formatting check try and pull up marginal notes that bleed into the bottom margin
